      content: '''You walk along a glowing path inside a magical cartoon forest.
The wind shimmers with golden sparkles… suddenly the ground shakes and a massive ancient stone gate rises, covered in blue glowing runes that pulse like a heartbeat.

A tiny, adorable guardian appears — round head, long beard, sparkly eyes — holding a lantern glowing with warm golden light.

He raises the lantern toward you and says:

"Only those who let go of the consumer mindset may enter the world of investing."

As he speaks, the runes on the gate rearrange themselves into three symbols:

💸 Spending
💰 Saving
📈 Investing

Only one begins to shine… the path of the investor.''',
